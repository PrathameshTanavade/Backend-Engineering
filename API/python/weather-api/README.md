# FastAPI - Current Weather API
This is a small project developed to showcase my basic knowledge of FastAPI library. In this, city name is used as the query parameter for the API. City name is case insensitive and is used to get the geographical co-ordinates from pre-loaded dictionary of consisting of 41352 cities and their co-ordinates. These co-ordinates are then used to query current weather from Open-Meteo Weather API which is a free API. The result of this query is then returned.
